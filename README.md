# ðŸŒŸ Welcome to **Lumiere -tv** ðŸŒŸ

Hey there! Welcome to **Lumiere -tv** â€” your cozy little movie hangout on the internet. Made with love (and a touch of code magic), Lumiere brings you endless movies, powered by the **TMDB API** and **VIDSRC APIs**.

---

## âœ¨ What's Inside?
- **Light & Dark Mode**: Pick a side â€” bright or moody!
- **Splash Screen**: Just a fun little screen to say hello before you dive into the content.
- **Home Screen Vibes**: Get greeted by the time of day! Yep, Lumiereâ€™s got that real-time touch.

---

## ðŸŽ¬ Just a Heads-Up!
All movies here come from **VIDSRC**! Iâ€™m just linking the magic â€” I donâ€™t own any of it, so donâ€™t come for me ðŸ˜…. Just sit back, click, and enjoy the show!

---

## ðŸŒˆ Future Updates?
* Uhh, yeah, Iâ€™m definitely looking to upgrade the UI (stay tuned for a glow-up ðŸ˜‰).

**Enjoy Lumiere -tv!** ðŸŽ‰
