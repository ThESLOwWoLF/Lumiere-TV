# 🌟 Welcome to **Lumiere -tv** 🌟

Hey there! Welcome to **Lumiere -tv** — your cozy little movie hangout on the internet. Made with love (and a touch of code magic), Lumiere brings you endless movies, powered by the **TMDB API** and **VIDSRC APIs**.

---

## ✨ What's Inside?
- **Light & Dark Mode**: Pick a side — bright or moody!
- **Splash Screen**: Just a fun little screen to say hello before you dive into the content.
- **Home Screen Vibes**: Get greeted by the time of day! Yep, Lumiere’s got that real-time touch.

## 🎬 Just a Heads-Up!

So, listen up, movie buffs! Every movie here is streamed from **VIDSRC** via an embed link. I’m just the middleman — none of this cinematic gold belongs to me! 😅 So if something’s off or the movie vanishes, don’t @ me, ok? I’m just here to spread the love of films, not get into trouble. Click, watch, vibe, repeat. 🍿

## 🌈 Future Updates?
* Uhh, yeah, I’m definitely looking to upgrade the UI (stay tuned for a glow-up 😉).

**Enjoy Lumiere -tv!** 🎉
